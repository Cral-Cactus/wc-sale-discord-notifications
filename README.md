## ⚙️ Configuration

   Enter your Discord Webhook URL (from your Discord server settings)

2. **Order Status Notifications**  
   Choose which order statuses should trigger notifications. You can also:
   - Add different webhook URLs per status
   - Choose unique embed colors

   Select which fields should appear in the Discord embed.

4. **Disable Product Image**  
   Toggle to prevent product image from appearing in the embed.

## 🔒 Duplicate Protection

To prevent duplicate Discord messages (e.g. when a user refreshes the thank-you page), a local file is used: discord_notification_log.txt

Each entry logs `order_id|event_type`, e.g. `1655 |new`.  
Before sending a message, the plugin checks if this log already contains that line.  
If it does, it skips sending.

This ensures each notification is only sent **once per order event**.
