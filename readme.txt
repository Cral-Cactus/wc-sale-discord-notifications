A powerful WooCommerce extension that sends order updates directly to your Discord server. ✨

== Description ==

This plugin sends a Discord notification for WooCommerce order events. It uses native WordPress/WooCommerce APIs and supports WooCommerce Custom Order Tables (v8+). You can choose which order statuses trigger notifications, customize which details are included, set different webhook URLs and embed colors per status, and optionally remove product images from the embed.

== Features ==

* ✅ Customizable message fields:
  * 🏷️ Order Status
  * 💳 Payment Info
  * 🛒 Product Lines (names, qty, price)
  * 🧩 Product Options (add-ons / custom fields)
  * 📅 Order Date
  * 👤 Billing Info
  * 🔢 Transaction ID
* 🖼️ Option to disable product image in the embed
* 🧩 Per-status webhook URL and embed color
* 🔒 Duplicate-send protection via internal tracking
* ⚙️ Built using native WordPress/WooCommerce APIs
* 🧠 Compatible with WooCommerce Custom Order Tables (v8+)

== Requirements ==

* WordPress 6.2 or higher (tested up to 6.8.2)
* WooCommerce 8.5 or higher (tested up to 10.1.2)
* PHP 7.4 or higher

== Installation ==

1. Download this plugin or clone the repo into `/wp-content/plugins/wc-sale-discord-notifications`.
2. Activate the plugin via **Plugins <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span></span></span> Installed Plugins**.
3. Go to **WooCommerce <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span></span></span> Discord Notifications**.
4. Configure your settings.

== Configuration ==

1. **Webhook URL**  
   Enter your Discord Webhook URL (from your Discord server settings).

2. **Order Status Notifications**  
   Choose which order statuses should trigger notifications. You can also:
   * Add different webhook URLs per status
   * Choose unique embed colors

3. **Information to Include**  
   Select which fields should appear in the Discord embed (status, payment info, items, custom product fields, order date, billing info, transaction ID).

4. **Disable Product Image**  
   Toggle this to prevent the product image from appearing in the embed.

== Duplicate Protection ==

To prevent duplicate Discord messages (for example, if the thank-you page is refreshed), the plugin keeps track of sent events. Each entry logs `order_id|event_type` (e.g. `1655|new`). Before sending, the plugin checks whether that combination has already been sent and skips if so. This ensures each notification is only sent **once per order event**.

== Usage ==

1. After installing and activating the plugin, go to **WooCommerce <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span></span></span> Discord Notifications**.
2. Paste your Discord Webhook URL and select which statuses should send notifications.
3. Choose which fields to include and whether to show product images.
4. Save your settings.
